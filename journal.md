Date: 8.31.25 - Subject: Journal entries. Engineering journals are important for keeping track of progress. I will write in this at least once a week.

Date: 9.6.25 - Subject: Brainstorming. This week was mostly focused on brainstorming ideas for our project. We have thought of a lot of things, and are leaning towards an idea that merges our top three. I did not really run into any technical issues this week, so I have nothing to note from that regard.

Date 9.13.25 - Subject: More Brainstorming. We aren't necessarily doing a great job at narrowing down what our app is actually going to do. We have a lot of fun crazy ideas, not a ton of reasonable ones that have a thought out plan.

Date 9.21.25 - Subject: Using git. I am struggling a little to get the hang of using branches. I am not used to working on things in git with a group and I'm having a hard time figuring out how everything works. Everything has such a specific procedure, and it frustrates me because I keep doing things wrong. I still haven't quite figured it out so I don't have any insight on how I can fix this problem right now.

Date 9.22.25 - Subject: Group work. Our group is having a little contention today because there has been a lack of communication up until this point. To solve this problem I am going to actively work to be more communicative throughout the week, and try to find a time for all team members to meet outside of class weekly.

Date 9.27.25 - Subject: Pivoting. Our group decided to pivot away from the dating app concept and towards a social media platform. I am against this idea because we've already created a detailed plan for our initial idea, and the reasoning for pivoting is weak. However, I am outnumbered in this opinion, so we are following through with the pivot. Even though this frustrated me, I am going to strive to have a positive attitude and complete this project to the best of my abilities.

Date 10.5.25 - Subject: Friday meeting. We had a really productive meeting on Friday, and I think that us meeting once a week outside of class time has been very beneficial. We are able to comunicate our plans and work on things together, which is much more efficient than seperately doing work and talking about it in a group chat.
