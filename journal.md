Date: 8.31.25 - Subject: Journal entries. Engineering journals are important for keeping track of progress. I will write in this at least once a week.

Date: 9.6.25 - Subject: Brainstorming. This week was mostly focused on brainstorming ideas for our project. We have thought of a lot of things, and are leaning towards an idea that merges our top three. I did not really run into any technical issues this week, so I have nothing to note from that regard.

Date 9.13.25 - Subject: More Brainstorming. We aren't necessarily doing a great job at narrowing down what our app is actually going to do. We have a lot of fun crazy ideas, not a ton of reasonable ones that have a thought out plan.

Date 9.21.25 - Subject: Using git. I am struggling a little to get the hang of using branches. I am not used to working on things in git with a group and I'm having a hard time figuring out how everything works. Everything has such a specific procedure, and it frustrates me because I keep doing things wrong. I still haven't quite figured it out so I don't have any insight on how I can fix this problem right now.

Date 9.22.25 - Subject: Group work. Our group is having a little contention today because there has been a lack of communication up until this point. To solve this problem I am going to actively work to be more communicative throughout the week, and try to find a time for all team members to meet outside of class weekly.
