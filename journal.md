Date: 8.31.25 - Subject: Journal entries. Engineering journals are important for keeping track of progress. I will write in this at least once a week.

Date: 9.6.25 - Subject: Brainstorming. This week was mostly focused on brainstorming ideas for our project. We have thought of a lot of things, and are leaning towards an idea that merges our top three. I did not really run into any technical issues this week, so I have nothing to note from that regard.
